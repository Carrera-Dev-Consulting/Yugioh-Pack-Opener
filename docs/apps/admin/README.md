# Admin App

We need an application that can allow us to update card/set information from on the API without needing to write adhoc queries to modfiy the records manually whenever there is a change to the set names or images and maybe even select an active image to use with the cards associated with the set. 

This app needs to support a flow to update a set by name, image, release date
We also need support or updating a cards, rarity, cost, and other fields


This will at first be unsecured so anyone could use the routes to make updates but will eventually move to be only a subset of admin emails that will be the allowed to modify records once we setup google authentication.
